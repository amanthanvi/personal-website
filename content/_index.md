I'm a cybersecurity specialist currently serving as an Information Technology Cybersecurity Specialist at the Department of Justice. With over six years of experience across federal agencies and the private sector, I focus on offensive and defensive security, threat intelligence, and secure system architecture.

My work has spanned from implementing cryptographic protocols for NASA spacecraft to conducting threat intelligence research on APTs with the NSA. I recently completed my Master of Engineering in Cybersecurity at the University of Maryland, College Park and am a published researcher in AI-driven threat detection.
