## Project Overview

**Program:** FIRE Program - AI & Deep Learning: Capital One ML stream  
**Organization:** University of Maryland, College Park  
**Location:** College Park, MD  
**Duration:** Fall 2021  

## Summary

A project aimed to assist in the battle against malicious software by creating a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model that detects and labels different types of programs as either malware or benign software.

## Technical Implementation

Built a sophisticated malware detection system using deep learning techniques. The model architecture consists of a dense layer with relu activation, a batch normalization layer, and a dropout layer, using 10 of these layers in total. This project takes inspiration from the paper "Malware Analysis with Artificial Intelligence and a Particular Attention on Results Interpretability" by Benjamin Marais, Tony Quertier, and Christophe Chesneau.
