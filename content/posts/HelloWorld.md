## print("Hello, World!") 

This is my first post on my personal website! Every programmer's journey begins with these two words, and it feels fitting to start my blog the same way.

### Why Start a Blog?

As someone who spends their days (and often nights) diving deep into cybersecurity challenges, I've realized how much I learn from the community. This blog is my way of giving back—sharing experiences, lessons learned, and maybe a few war stories from the trenches of federal cybersecurity.

### What to Expect

I'll be writing about:
- 🔒 Cybersecurity insights and tutorials
- 💻 Technical deep-dives and research findings
- 🏆 CTF writeups and challenge walkthroughs
- 🚀 Career experiences and lessons learned
- 🔧 Cool tools and technologies I'm exploring

### A Bit About Me

At the time of writing this, I'm a computer science student at UMD, already knee-deep in cybersecurity internships and loving every minute of it. Fast forward to today, and I'm protecting government systems at the Department of Justice while pursuing my Master's degree.

### Let's Connect!

Whether you're a fellow security enthusiast, a student starting your journey, or just curious about cybersecurity, I hope you'll find something valuable here. Feel free to reach out—I'm always happy to chat about security, technology, or the best coffee shops near campus.

Here's to new beginnings and many more posts to come!

```python
while True:
    learn()
    hack(ethically=True)
    share()
    repeat()
```
