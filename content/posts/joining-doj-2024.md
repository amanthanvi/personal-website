## Joining the Department of Justice

I'm pleased to announce that I've joined the Department of Justice as an Information Technology Cybersecurity Specialist (GS-07). This position represents both the culmination of my academic journey and the beginning of my commitment to federal service through the CyberCorps Scholarship for Service program.

### Why the Department of Justice

The decision to join DOJ was driven by several key factors:

**Mission Alignment**  
The opportunity to protect systems that directly support the administration of justice aligns with my commitment to public service and cybersecurity excellence.

**Technical Scope**  
DOJ's enterprise-level security challenges provide an environment where I can apply and expand my expertise in threat intelligence, incident response, and security architecture.

**Professional Development**  
Working alongside experienced federal cybersecurity professionals offers invaluable opportunities for growth and knowledge transfer.

### Initial Observations

The complexity and scale of DOJ's security infrastructure exceeded my expectations. The team's depth of expertise and collaborative approach to knowledge sharing has created an ideal environment for professional growth. Working with enterprise-level security systems has provided immediate opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios.

### Current Responsibilities

While operational details remain classified, my role encompasses:
- Implementation of security controls for critical infrastructure
- Deployment and management of advanced security technologies
- Collaboration with senior cybersecurity professionals
- Application of NIST frameworks in production environments

### Looking Ahead

This role is exactly where I wanted to be â€“ applying everything I've learned to protect systems that matter. From NASA spacecraft to financial markets to now the justice system, each step has prepared me for this moment.

To my fellow students and CyberCorps scholars: federal service is more than just fulfilling an obligation. It's an opportunity to work on meaningful problems with brilliant people while serving your country.

This position represents an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to national security while advancing my expertise in federal cybersecurity operations.
