## SocialCipher: A Multimodal Framework for Proactive Threat Detection with SentIntel

I'm pleased to announce that our paper has been accepted and presented at the IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CAI) 2025 in Santa Clara, California.

### Research Overview

The research, conducted in collaboration with MIT Lincoln Laboratory, introduces a multimodal framework for proactive cyber threat detection using sentiment analysis and Large Language Models (LLMs). The work addresses the challenge of identifying potential threats during their planning stages rather than after execution.

### Technical Contribution

SocialCipher presents a novel approach combining:
- Multimodal data analysis across multiple threat intelligence sources
- Sentiment Intelligence (SentIntel) engine for pattern recognition
- LLM integration for contextual understanding of threat indicators
- Real-time processing capabilities for actionable intelligence

### Conference Presentation

The paper was presented at IEEE CAI 2025, where it received positive feedback from the research community. The conference provided valuable opportunities for discussion with other researchers working on AI applications in cybersecurity.

### Acknowledgments

This research was made possible through collaboration with MIT Lincoln Laboratory and the support of my co-authors and mentors.

The full paper will be available in the IEEE Digital Library.
