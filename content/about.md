I am a cybersecurity professional with over six years of progressive experience in offensive and defensive security across federal agencies and private sector organizations. Currently serving as an Information Technology Cybersecurity Specialist (GS-07) at the Department of Justice with an active U.S. Secret clearance.

My career has encompassed diverse security challenges â€“ from implementing cryptographic protocols for NASA spacecraft to conducting penetration testing at Nasdaq, and from researching advanced persistent threats with the NSA to developing AI-driven threat detection systems. I hold a Master of Engineering in Cybersecurity from the University of Maryland (4.0 GPA) and maintain an active Secret clearance.
